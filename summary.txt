Project name: The Art of Music

Project description: Our project is a website that takes in a song the user submits, fetches the cover 
art of the album in which the song appears, and applies a shader to the cover art. The shader
manipulates the art based on the song's audio features, namely speechiness, valence, and danceability. 
We implemented the category "Document Search" by using the Spotify API to fetch the cover art and 
the song's audio features. Joyce was responsible for building the search form and fetching the necessary
data using the Spotify API. Jackie was responsible for designing and coding multiple shaders for the final
effect in p5.js. 

Tech stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, p5.js, webGL
